These are the results Hunter gave me in a shared folder location (OneDrive).

EG_Raw_Counts.csv - (Assumed) Counts aggregated from htseq-counts.
EG_Normalized_Counts.csv - Normalized counts after model fitting.

Directories:

They seem to be the same analysis results differing either in ID versus gene name, 
or for differential expression results, the column used to sort the data file.

Gene names are not available for all genes, so gene IDs are used when necessary 
(most of the time).

geneID_DifferentialExpressionResults - 
    Using gene IDs instead of gene names.

    Each file of the type columns: 
        gene_id  baseMean log2FoldChange     lfcSE        stat    pvalue      padj

    Rows are each gene. The factor level comparison is in the file name. 
    The column being sorted is also included: _FC for fold change; _PVal for pvalue.
    The contents appear to be the same otherwise.

GeneIDs -
    HS Counts files with Gene IDs.

Gene Names -
    HS Counts files with Gene Names.
    DifferentialCSVs -
        Same as geneID_DifferentialExpressionResults, but with gene Names as described
        above. FC/FDR are the columns used to sort the indicated file.
        R rds files also available.
