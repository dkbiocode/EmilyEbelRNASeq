You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.

You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics
into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across
all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables,
as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)

You are given data from such a report. Your task is to analyse the data, and
give 1-2 bullet points of a very short and concise overall summary for the results.
Don't waste words: mention only the important QC issues. If there are no issues, just say so.
Just print one or two bullet points, nothing else.
Please do not add any extra headers to the response.

Use markdown to format your reponse for readability. Use directives with pre-defined classes
.text-green, .text-red, and .text-yellow to highlight severity, e.g. :span[39.2%]{.text-red}.
Highlight any mentioned sample names or sample named prefixes or suffixes with a sample directive,
and make sure to use the same color classes for severity, e.g. :sample[A1001.2003]{.text-yellow}
or :sample[A1001]{.text-yellow}. Do not put multiple sample names inside one directive.

You must use only multiples of 4 spaces to indent nested lists.



Two examples of short summaries:

- :span[11/13 samples]{.text-green} show consistent metrics within expected ranges.
- :sample[A1001.2003]{.text-red} and :sample[A1001.2004]{.text-red} exhibit extremely high percentage of :span[duplicates]{.text-red} (:span[65.54%]{.text-red} and :span[83.14%]{.text-red}, respectively).

- All samples show good quality metrics with :span[75.7-77.0%]{.text-green} CpG methylation and :span[76.3-86.0%]{.text-green} alignment rates
- :sample[2wk]{.text-yellow} samples show slightly higher duplication (:span[11-15%]{.text-yellow}) compared to :sample[1wk]{.text-green} samples (:span[6-9%]{.text-green})'

Tools used in the report:

1. Bowtie 2 / HiSAT2
Description: <p>Results from both Bowtie 2 and HISAT2, tools for aligning reads against a reference genome.</p>
Links: http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/, https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/

----------------------

Tool: Bowtie 2 / HiSAT2
Section: Paired-end alignments
Section description: This plot shows the number of reads aligning to the reference in different ways.
                <div class="alert alert-warning">Please note that single mate alignment counts are halved to tally with pair counts properly.</div>
Section help text: There are 6 possible types of alignment:
<ul>
<li><strong>PE mapped uniquely</strong>: Pair has only one occurence in the reference genome.</li>
<li><strong>PE mapped discordantly uniquely</strong>: Pair has only one occurence but not in proper pair.</li>
<li><strong>PE one mate mapped uniquely</strong>: One read of a pair has one occurence.</li>
<li><strong>PE multimapped</strong>: Pair has multiple occurence.</li>
<li><strong>PE one mate multimapped</strong>: One read of a pair has multiple occurence.</li>
<li><strong>PE neither mate aligned</strong>: Pair has no occurence.</li>
</ul>
